.. warning::

    This page is intended for experienced users only. If you follow these
    instructions, you are not protected from footguns elimited with the
    introduction of the ``kres-manager``. However, if you want to continue
    using Knot Resolver the same as before the version ``6.0.0`` this is a chapter
    for you.

    For new and less experienced users, we recommend using the newer approach
    starting in the :ref:`Getting Started <gettingstarted-startup>` chapter.
