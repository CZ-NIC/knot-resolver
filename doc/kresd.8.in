.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Knot DNS Resolver is a DNSSEC-enabled full caching resolver.
.P
Default mode of operation: when it receives a DNS query it iteratively
asks authoritative nameservers starting from root zone (.) and ending
with a nameservers authoritative for queried name. Automatic DNSSEC means
verification of integrity of authoritative responses by following
keys and signatures starting from root. Root trust anchor is automatically
bootstrapped from IANA, or you can provide a file with root trust anchors
(same format as Unbound or BIND9 root keys file).

The daemon also caches intermediate answers into cache, which by default
uses LMDB memory-mapped database. This has a significant advantage over
in-memory caches as the process may be stopped and restarted without
loss of cache entries. In multi-user scenario a shared cache
is potential privacy/security issue, with kresd each user can have resolver cache
in their private directory and use it in similar fashion to keychain.

By default, no configuration is needed, only a directory where the daemon can store
runtime data (cache, control sockets, ...)
.P
To use a locally running
.B kresd
for resolving put
.sp
.RS 6n
nameserver 127.0.0.1
.RE
.sp
into
.IR resolv.conf (5)
and start
.B kresd
.PP
.nf
.RS 6n
$ kresd -a 127.0.0.1 -k root.keys
[system] interactive mode

The daemon may be configured also as a plain forwarder using query policies, that requires
creating a file
.B config
in daemon runtime directory. See \fIdaemon/README.md\fR for more information about interacting
with CLI and configuration file options, or visit
.B https://knot-resolver.readthedocs.io
online documentation.

The available CLI options are:
.TP
.B \-a\fI addr[@port]\fR, \fB\-\-addr=\fI<addr[@port]>
Listen on given address (and port) pair. If no port is given, \fI53\fR is used as a default.
Option may be passed multiple times to listen on more addresses.
.TP
.B \-t\fI addr[@port]\fR, \fB\-\-tls=\fI<addr[@port]>
Listen using TLS on given address (and port) pair. If no port is
given, \fI853\fR is used as a default.  Option may be passed multiple
times to listen on more addresses.
.TP
.B \-S\fI fd\fR, \fB\-\-fd=\fI<fd>
Listen on given file descriptor(s), passed by supervisor.
Option may be passed multiple times to listen on more file descriptors.
.TP
.B \-T\fI fd\fR, \-\-tlsfd=\fI<fd>
Listen using TLS on given file descriptor(s), passed by supervisor.
Option may be passed multiple times to listen on more file descriptors.
.TP
.B \-c\fI config\fR, \fB\-\-config=\fI<config>
Set the config file with settings for kresd to read instead of reading the
file at the default location (\fIconfig\fR). The syntax is
described in \fIdaemon/README.md\fR.
.TP
.B \-k\fI keyfile\fR, \fB\-\-keyfile=\fI<keyfile>
(Recommended!) Automatically managed root trust anchors file.
Root trust anchors in this file are managed using standard RFC 5011 (Automated Updates of DNS Security Trust Anchors).
Kresd needs write access to the directory containing the keyfile.

If the file does not exist, it will be automatically boostrapped from IANA using HTTPS protocol
and warning that you need to to check the key before trusting it will be issued.

The file contains DNSKEY/DS records in presentation format,
and is compatible with Unbound and BIND 9 root key files.
.TP
.B \-K\fI keyfile\fR, \fB\-\-keyfile-ro=\fI<keyfile>
(Discouraged) Static root trust anchors file. The file is not updated by kresd. Use of this option is discouraged because it will break your installation when the trust anchor key changes!

Default: "@KEYFILE_DEFAULT@" (can be empty if your distribution did not provide one)
.TP
.B \-m\fI path\fR, \fB\-\-moduledir=\fI<path>
Override the directory that is searched for modules.  Default: @MODULEDIR@
.TP
.B \-f\fI N\fR, \fB\-\-forks=\fI<N>
With this option, the daemon is started in non-interactive mode and instead creates a
UNIX socket in \fIrundir\fR that the operator can connect to for interactive session.
A number greater than 1 forks the daemon N times, all forks will bind to same addresses
and the kernel will load-balance between them on Linux with \fISO_REUSEPORT\fR support.

When socket-activated and supervised by systemd or the equivalent, kresd defaults to
--forks=1, and must not be set to any other value.  If you want multiple concurrent
processes supervised in this way, they should be supervised independently.
.TP
.B \-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet
Daemon will refrain from printing any informative messages, not even a prompt.
.TP
.B \-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose
Increase verbosity. If given multiple times, more information is logged.
This is in addition to the verbosity (if any) from the config file.
.TP
.B \-h
Show short commandline option help.
.TP
.B \-V
Show the version.
