 * @file resolve.h

 * user to plug it into existing event loop or I/O code.
 *
 * # Example usage of the iterative API:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 *
 * // Create request and its memory pool
 * struct kr_request req = {
 * 	.pool = {
 * 		.ctx = mp_new (4096),
 * 		.alloc = (mm_alloc_t) mp_alloc
 * 	}
 * };
 *
 * // Setup and provide input query
 * int state = kr_resolve_begin(&req, ctx);
 * state = kr_resolve_consume(&req, query);
 *
 * // Generate answer
 * while (state == KR_STATE_PRODUCE) {
 *
 *     // Additional query generate, do the I/O and pass back answer
 *     state = kr_resolve_produce(&req, &addr, &type, query);
 *     while (state == KR_STATE_CONSUME) {
 *         int ret = sendrecv(addr, proto, query, resp);
 *
 *         // If I/O fails, make "resp" empty
 *         state = kr_resolve_consume(&request, addr, resp);
 *         knot_pkt_clear(resp);
 *     }
 *     knot_pkt_clear(query);
 * }
 *
 * // "state" is either DONE or FAIL
 * kr_resolve_finish(&request, state);
 *
 * @endcode

 * Motivation: XSK wire allocation is an overlap of library and daemon:
 *  - it needs to be called from the library
 *  - it needs to rely on some daemon's internals
 *  - the library (currently) isn't allowed to directly use symbols from daemon
 *    (contrary to modules)
 * That makes separation difficult, e.g. some of our tests run without daemon.
 *
 * Note: after we obtain the wire, we're obliged to send it out.
