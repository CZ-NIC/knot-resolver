   :param: New checking level specified as string (*optional*).
   :return: Current checking level.

   Get or change resolver strictness checking level.

   By default, resolver runs in *normal* mode. There are possibly many small adjustments
   hidden behind the mode settings, but the main idea is that in *permissive* mode, the resolver
   tries to resolve a name with as few lookups as possible, while in *strict* mode it spends much
   more effort resolving and checking referral path. However, if majority of the traffic is covered
   by DNSSEC, some of the strict checking actions are counter-productive.

   .. [#example_glue] The examples show glue records acceptable from servers

        Unacceptable or missing glue records trigger resolution of names listed
        in NS records before following respective delegation.
