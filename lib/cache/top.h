/// The statistics are stored persistently beside LMDB data file
/// and their half-life is currently 5 hours, taking ~3-day traffic into account.
/// Each accessed cache entry is counted only once within a single request context
/// and the price of the access is inversely proportional to the size of the cache entry;

/// The keys currently stored in KRU and in cache need not necessarily correspond.

/// likely due to the expired TTL, but still has high load assinged in KRU.
/// Or that the KRU load of a key decreased to zero after hours or days of inactivity,
/// but there was no need to remove the (possibly expired) entry from the cache.
