# Ideally, the CI would build it's own container and use it afterwards. This workflow should be supported,
# at least according to the GitLab documentation:
# https://gitlab.nic.cz/help/user/packages/container_registry/index#container-registry-examples-with-gitlab-cicd
# Sadly, it does not work on our infrastructure. I did not however test it thoroughly and/or consulted it with
# anyone else. So it might be fixable. For now, let's leave the config here and we might fix it in the future.
