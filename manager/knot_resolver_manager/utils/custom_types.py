    """
    Subclasses of this class can be used as type annotations in 'DataParser'. When a value
    is being parsed from a serialized format (e.g. JSON/YAML), an object will be created by
    calling the constructor of the appropriate type on the field value. The only limitation
    is that the value MUST NOT be `None`.

    Example:
    ```
    class A(DataParser):
        field: MyCustomValueType

    A.from_json('{"field": "value"}') == A(field=MyCustomValueType("value"))
    ```

    There is no validation done on the wrapped value. The only condition is that
    it can't be `None`. If you want to perform any validation during creation,
    raise a `DataValidationException` in case of errors.
