# Knot Resolver Manager

Knot Resolver Manager is a configuration tool for [Knot Resolver](https://gitlab.nic.cz/knot/knot-resolver). The Manager hides the complexity of running several independent resolver processes while ensuring zero-downtime reconfiguration with YAML/JSON declarative configuration and an optional HTTP API for dynamic changes.

## Development
