Timers and events reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The timer represents exactly the thing described in the examples - it allows you to execute closures_
after specified time, or event recurrent events. Time is always described in milliseconds,
but there are convenient variables that you can use - ``sec, minute, hour``.
For example, ``5 * hour`` represents five hours, or 5*60*60*100 milliseconds.

.. function:: event.after(time, function)

   :return: event id

   Execute function after the specified time has passed.
   The first parameter of the callback is the event itself.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: lua

      event.after(1 * minute, function() print('Hi!') end)

.. function:: event.recurrent(interval, function)

   :return: event id

   Execute function immediatelly and then periodically after each ``interval``.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: lua

      msg_count = 0
      event.recurrent(5 * sec, function(e)
         msg_count = msg_count + 1
         print('Hi #'..msg_count)
      end)

.. function:: event.reschedule(event_id, timeout)

   Reschedule a running event, it has no effect on canceled events.
   New events may reuse the event_id, so the behaviour is undefined if the function
   is called after another event is started.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: lua

      local interval = 1 * minute
      event.after(1 * minute, function (ev)
         print('Good morning!')
         -- Halve the interval for each iteration
         interval = interval / 2
         event.reschedule(ev, interval)
      end)

.. function:: event.cancel(event_id)

   Cancel running event, it has no effect on already canceled events.
   New events may reuse the event_id, so the behaviour is undefined if the function
   is called after another event is started.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: lua

      e = event.after(1 * minute, function() print('Hi!') end)
      event.cancel(e)

Watch for file descriptor activity. This allows embedding other event loops or simply
firing events when a pipe endpoint becomes active. In another words, asynchronous
notifications for daemon.

.. function:: event.socket(fd, cb)

   :param number fd: file descriptor to watch
   :param cb: closure or callback to execute when fd becomes active
   :return: event id

   Execute function when there is activity on the file descriptor and calls a closure
   with event id as the first parameter, status as second and number of events as third.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: lua

      e = event.socket(0, function(e, status, nevents)
         print('activity detected')
      end)
      e.cancel(e)

Asynchronous function execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `event` package provides a very basic mean for non-blocking execution - it allows running code when activity on a file descriptor is detected, and when a certain amount of time passes. It doesn't however provide an easy to use abstraction for non-blocking I/O. This is instead exposed through the `worker` package (if `cqueues` Lua package is installed in the system).

.. function:: worker.coroutine(function)

   Start a new coroutine with given function (closure). The function can do I/O or run timers without blocking the main thread. See cqueues_ for documentation of possible operations and synchronization primitives. The main limitation is that you can't wait for a finish of a coroutine from processing layers, because it's not currently possible to suspend and resume execution of processing layers.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: lua

      worker.coroutine(function ()
        for i = 0, 10 do
          print('executing', i)
          worker.sleep(1)
        end
      end)

.. function:: worker.sleep(seconds)

   Pause execution of current function (asynchronously if running inside a worker coroutine).

Example:

.. code-block:: lua

     function async_print(testname, sleep)
             log(testname .. ': system time before sleep' .. tostring(os.time())
             worker.sleep(sleep)  -- other coroutines continue execution now
             log(testname .. ': system time AFTER sleep' .. tostring(os.time())
     end

     worker.coroutine(function() async_print('call #1', 5) end)
     worker.coroutine(function() async_print('call #2', 3) end)

Output from this example demonstrates that both calls to function ``async_print`` were executed asynchronously:


.. code-block:: none

     call #2: system time before sleep 1578065073
     call #1: system time before sleep 1578065073
     call #2: system time AFTER  sleep 1578065076
     call #1: system time AFTER  sleep 1578065078
