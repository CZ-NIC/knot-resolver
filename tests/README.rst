Tests
=====

The following is a non-comprehensitve lists of various tests that can be found
in this repo. These can be enabled by the build system.

Unit tests
----------

The unit tests depend on cmocka_ and can easily be executed after compilation.
They are enabled by default (if ``cmocka`` is found).

.. code-block:: bash

        $ ninja -C build_dir
        $ meson test -C build_dir --suite unit

Postinstall tests
-----------------

There following tests require a working installation of kresd.  The
binary ``kresd`` found in ``$PATH`` will be tested. When testing through meson,
``$PATH`` is modified automatically and you just need to make sure to install
kresd first.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ ninja install -C build_dir

Config tests
------------

Config tests utilize the kresd's lua config file to execute arbitrary tests,
typically testing various modules, their API etc.

To enable these tests, specify ``-Dconfig_tests=enabled`` option for meson.
Multiple dependencies are required (refer to meson's output when configuring
the build dir).

.. code-block:: bash

        $ meson configure build_dir -Dconfig_tests=enabled
        $ ninja install -C build_dir
        $ meson test -C build_dir --suite config

Extra tests
-----------

The extra tests require a large set of additional dependencies and executing
them outside of upstream development is probably redundant.

To enable these tests, specify ``-Dextra_tests=enabled`` option for meson.
Multiple dependencies are required (refer to meson's output when configuring
the build dir). Enabling ``extra_tests`` automatically enables config tests as
well.

**Integration tests**

The integration tests are using Deckard, the `DNS test harness
<https://gitlab.nic.cz/knot/deckard>`_. The tests simulate specific DNS
scenarios, including authoritative server and their responses. These tests rely
on linux namespaces, refer to Deckard documentation for more info.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ meson configure build_dir -Dextra_tests=enabled
        $ ninja install -C build_dir
        $ meson test -C build_dir --suite integration

**Pytests**

The pytest suite is designed to spin up a kresd instance, acquire a connected
socket, and then performs any tests on it. These tests are used to test for
example TCP, TLS and its connection management.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ meson configure build_dir -Dextra_tests=enabled
        $ ninja install -C build_dir
        $ meson test -C build_dir --suite pytests

Useful meson commands
---------------------

It's possible to run only specific test suite or a test.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ meson test -C build_dir --help
   $ meson test -C build_dir --list
   $ meson test -C build_dir --no-suite postinstall
   $ meson test -C build_dir integration.serve_stale
