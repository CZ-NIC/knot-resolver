Knot Resolver 1.3.2 (2017-07-xx)
================================

Security
--------
- fix possible opportunities to use insecure data from cache as keys
  for validation

Bugfixes
--------
- daemon: check existence of config file even if rundir isn't specified
- policy.FORWARD and STUB: use RTT tracking to choose servers (#125, #208)
- dns64: fix CNAME problems (#203)  It still won't work with policy.STUB.
- hints: better interpretation of hosts-like files (#204)
         also, error out if a bad entry is encountered in the file

Improvements
------------
- embedded LMDB fallback: update 0.9.18 -> 0.9.21


Knot Resolver 1.3.1 (2017-06-23)
================================

Bugfixes
--------
- modules/http: fix finding the static files (bug from 1.3.0)
- policy.FORWARD: fix some cases of CNAMEs obstructing search for zone cuts


Knot Resolver 1.3.0 (2017-06-13)
================================

Security
--------
- Refactor handling of AD flag and security status of resource records.
  In some cases it was possible for secure domains to get cached as
  insecure, even for a TLD, leading to disabled validation.
  It also fixes answering with non-authoritative data about nameservers.

Improvements
------------
- major feature: support for forwarding with validation (#112).
  The old policy.FORWARD action now does that; the previous non-validating
  mode is still avaliable as policy.STUB except that also uses caching (#122).
- command line: specify ports via @ but still support # for compatibility
- policy: recognize 100.64.0.0/10 as local addresses
- layer/iterate: *do* retry repeatedly if REFUSED, as we can't yet easily
  retry with other NSs while avoiding retrying with those who REFUSED
- modules: allow changing the directory where modules are found,
  and do not search the default library path anymore.

Bugfixes
--------
- validate: fix insufficient caching for some cases (relatively rare)
- avoid putting "duplicate" record-sets into the answer (#198)


Knot Resolver 1.2.6 (2017-04-24)
================================

Security
--------
- dnssec: don't set AD flag for NODATA answers if wildcard non-existence
  is not guaranteed due to opt-out in NSEC3

Improvements
------------
- layer/iterate: don't retry repeatedly if REFUSED

Bugfixes
--------
- lib/nsrep: revert some changes to NS reputation tracking that caused
  severe problems to some users of 1.2.5 (#178 and #179)
- dnssec: fix verification of wildcarded non-singleton RRsets
- dnssec: allow wildcards located directly under the root
- layer/rrcache: avoid putting answer records into queries in some cases


Knot Resolver 1.2.5 (2017-04-05)
================================

Security
--------
- layer/validate: clear AD if closest encloser proof has opt-outed
  NSEC3 (#169)
- layer/validate: check if NSEC3 records in wildcard expansion proof
  has an opt-out
- dnssec/nsec: missed wildcard no-data answers validation has been
  implemented

Improvements
------------
- modules/dnstap: a DNSTAP support module
  (Contributed by Vicky Shrestha)
- modules/workarounds: a module adding workarounds for known
  DNS protocol violators
- layer/iterate: fix logging of glue addresses
- kr_bitcmp: allow bits=0 and consequently 0.0.0.0/0 matches in view
  and renumber modules.
- modules/padding: Improve default padding of responses
  (Contributed by Daniel Kahn Gillmor)
- New kresc client utility (experimental; don't rely on the API yet)

Bugfixes
--------
- trust anchors: Improve trust anchors storage format (#167)
- trust anchors: support non-root TAs, one domain per file
- policy.DENY: set AA flag and clear AD flag
- lib/resolve: avoid unnecessary DS queries
- lib/nsrep: don't treat servers with NOIP4 + NOIP6 flags as timeouted
- layer/iterate: During packet classification (answer vs. referral)
  don't analyze AUTHORITY section in authoritative answer if ANSWER
  section contains records that have been requested


Knot Resolver 1.2.4 (2017-03-09)
================================

Security
--------
- Knot Resolver 1.2.0 and higher could return AD flag for insecure
  answer if the daemon received answer with invalid RRSIG several
  times in a row.

Improvements
------------
- modules/policy: allow QTRACE policy to be chained with other
  policies
- hints.add_hosts(path): a new property
- module: document the API and simplify the code
- policy.MIRROR: support IPv6 link-local addresses
- policy.FORWARD: support IPv6 link-local addresses
- add net.outgoing_{v4,v6} to allow specifying address to use for
  connections

Bugfixes
--------
- layer/iterate: some improvements in cname chain unrolling
- layer/validate: fix duplicate records in AUTHORITY section in case
  of WC expansion proof
- lua: do *not* truncate cache size to unsigned
- forwarding mode: correctly forward +cd flag
- fix a potential memory leak
- don't treat answers that contain DS non-existance proof as insecure
- don't store NSEC3 and their signatures in the cache
- layer/iterate: when processing delegations, check if qname is at or
  below new authority


Knot Resolver 1.2.3 (2017-02-23)
================================

Bugfixes
--------
- Disable storing GLUE records into the cache even in the
  (non-default) QUERY_PERMISSIVE mode
- iterate: skip answer RRs that don't match the query
- layer/iterate: some additional processing for referrals
- lib/resolve: zonecut fetching error was fixed


Knot Resolver 1.2.2 (2017-02-10)
================================

Bugfixes:
---------
- Fix -k argument processing to avoid out-of-bounds memory accesses
- lib/resolve: fix zonecut fetching for explicit DS queries
- hints: more NULL checks
- Fix TA bootstrapping for multiple TAs in the IANA XML file

Testing:
--------
- Update tests to run tests with and without QNAME minimization


Knot Resolver 1.2.1 (2017-02-01)
====================================

Security:
---------
- Under certain conditions, a cached negative answer from a CD query
  would be reused to construct response for non-CD queries, resulting
  in Insecure status instead of Bogus.  Only 1.2.0 release was affected.

Documentation
-------------
- Update the typo in the documentation: The query trace policy is
  named policy.QTRACE (and not policy.TRACE)

Bugfixes:
---------
- lua: make the map command check its arguments


Knot Resolver 1.2.0 (2017-01-24)
====================================

Security:
---------
- In a policy.FORWARD() mode, the AD flag was being always set by mistake.
  It is now cleared, as the policy.FORWARD() doesn't do DNSSEC validation yet.

Improvements:
-------------
- The DNSSEC Validation has been refactored, fixing many resolving
  failures.
- Add module `version` that checks for updates and CVEs periodically.
- Support RFC7830: EDNS(0) padding in responses over TLS.
- Support CD flag on incoming requests.
- hints module: previously /etc/hosts was loaded by default, but not anymore.
  Users can now actually avoid loading any file.
- DNS over TLS now creates ephemeral certs.
- Configurable cache.{min,max}_tll option, with max_ttl defaulting to 6 days.
- Option to reorder RRs in the response.
- New policy.QTRACE policy to print packet contents

Bugfixes:
---------
- Trust Anchor configuration is now more robust.
- Correctly answer NOTIMPL for meta-types and non-IN RR classes.
- Free TCP buffer on cancelled connection.
- Fix crash in hints module on empty hints file, and fix non-lowercase hints.

Miscelaneous:
-------------
- It now requires knot >= 2.3.1 to link successfully.
- The API+ABI for modules changed slightly.
- New LRU implementation.

 - DAF: Allow forwarding to custom port
 - systemd: Read EnvironmentFile and user $KRESD_ARGS
 - systemd: Update systemd units to be named after daemon


Knot Resolver 1.1.0 (2016-08-12)

Improvements:
-------------
 - RFC7873 DNS Cookies
 - RFC7858 DNS over TLS
 - HTTP/2 web interface, RESTful API
 - Metrics exported in Prometheus
 - DNS firewall module
 - Explicit CNAME target fetching in strict mode
 - Query minimisation improvements
