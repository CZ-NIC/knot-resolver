"""
The parsing and validation of the datamodel is dependent on a global state:
- a file system path used for resolving relative paths


Commentary from @vsraier:
=========================

While this is not ideal, it is the best we can do at the moment. When I created this module,
the datamodel was dependent on the global state implicitely. The validation procedures just read
the current working directory. This module is the first step in removing the global dependency.

At some point in the future, it might be interesting to add something like a "validation context"
to the modelling tools. It is not technically complicated, but it requires
massive model changes I am not willing to make at the moment. Ideally, when implementing this,
the BaseSchema would turn into an empty class without any logic. Not even a constructor. All logic
would be in the ObjectMapper class. Similar to how Gson works in Java or AutoMapper in C#.
