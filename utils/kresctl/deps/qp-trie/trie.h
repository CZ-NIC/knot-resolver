/*! \brief Start a COW transaction
 *
 * A copy-on-write transaction starts by obtaining a write lock (in
 * your application code) followed by a call to trie_cow(). This
 * creates a shared clone of the trie and saves both old and new roots
 * in the COW context.
 *
 * During the COW transaction, you call trie_cow_ins() or
 * trie_cow_del() as necessary. These calls ensure that the relevant
 * parts of the (new) trie are copied so that they can be modified
 * freely.
 *
 * Your trie_val_t objects must be able to distinguish their
 * reachability, either shared, or old-only, or new-only. Before a COW
 * transaction the reachability of your objects is indeterminate.
 * During a transaction, any trie_val_t objects that might be affected
 * (because they are adjacent to a trie_get_cow() or trie_del_cow())
 * are first marked as shared using the callback you pass to
 * trie_cow().
 *
 * When the transaction is complete, to commit, call trie_cow_new() to
 * get the new root, swap the old and new trie roots (e.g. with
 * rcu_xchg_pointer()), wait for readers to finish with the old trie
 * (e.g. using synchronize_rcu()), then call trie_cow_commit(). For a
 * rollback, you can just call trie_cow_rollback() without waiting
 * since that doesn't conflict with readers. After trie_cow_commit()
 * or trie_cow_rollback() have finished, you can release your write
 * lock.
 *
 * Concurrent reading of the old trie is allowed during a transaction
 * provided that it is known when all readers have finished with the
 * old version, e.g. using rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock().
 * There must be only one write transaction at a time.
 *
 * \param old		the old trie
 * \param mark_shared	callback to mark a leaf as shared (can be NULL)
 * \param d		extra data for the callback
 * \return		a pointer to a COW context,
 *			or NULL if there was a failure

 * path are marked as shared using the mark_shared callback passed to
 * trie_cow().
 *
 * It is your responsibility to COW your trie_val_t objects. If you copy an
