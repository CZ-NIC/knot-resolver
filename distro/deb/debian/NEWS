knot-resolver (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Knot Resolver systemd service units are now templated, so that multiple
  processes can run concurrently on multi-core systems.  For a full
  overview of the status of all the running daemons, use:

      systemctl status system-kresd.slice

  For more information about this setup, please see kresd.systemd(7).

knot-resolver (1.1.0~git2016072900-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Knot Resolver now starts and runs under unprivileged user and uses a
  socket activations to bind on the privileged ports.  That means that if
  you use anything more complicated than that you need to either override
  the default service file with `systemd edit kresd.service` and
  `systemd edit kresd.socket` to add more IP addresses, or just disable
  it with `systemd mask kresd*.socket kresd.service` and provide your
  own custom system service file tailored to your needs.
