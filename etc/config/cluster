-- Config file example useable for larger resolver farms
-- In this case cache should be made as large as possible, and prefetching turned off
-- as the resolver is busy most of the time.
-- Alternative is using `etcd` as a configuration backend.
-- Refer to manual: https://knot-resolver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/daemon.html#configuration

-- Listen on localhost and external interface
net = { '127.0.0.1', '::1', '192.168.1.1' }

-- Drop root privileges
user('knot-resolver', 'knot-resolver')

-- Auto-maintain root TA
trust_anchors.file = 'root.keys'

-- Large cache size, so we don't need to flush ever
-- This can be larger than available RAM, least frequently accessed
-- records will be paged out as long as there's enough disk space to back it
cache.size = 100 * GB

-- Load Useful modules
modules = {
	'hints > iterate', -- Load /etc/hosts and allow custom root hints
	'stats',    -- Track internal statistics
	graphite = { -- Send statistics to local InfluxDB
		-- `worker.id` allows us to keep per-fork statistics
		prefix = hostname()..worker.id,
		-- Address of the Graphite/InfluxDB server
		host = '192.168.1.2',
	},
}

-- Use local root server copy for performance reasons
hints.root({
  ['j.root-servers.net.'] = { '192.168.1.4', '2001:503:c27::2:30', '192.58.128.30' }
})

-- Apply RPZ for all clients, default rule is DENY
policy.add(policy.rpz(policy.DENY, 'blacklist.rpz'))
