Query policies
--------------

This module can block, rewrite, or alter inbound queries based on user-defined policies.
By default, it blocks queries to reverse lookups in private subnets as per :rfc:`1918`, :rfc:`5735` and :rfc:`5737`.
You can however extend it to deflect `Slow drip DNS attacks <https://blog.secure64.com/?p=377>`_ for example, or gray-list resolution of misbehaving zones.

There are several policies implemented:

* ``pattern``
  - applies action if QNAME matches `regular expression <http://lua-users.org/wiki/PatternsTutorial>`_
* ``suffix``
  - applies action if QNAME suffix matches given list of suffixes (useful for "is domain in zone" rules),
  uses `Aho-Corasick`_ string matching algorithm implemented by `@jgrahamc`_ (CloudFlare, Inc.) (BSD 3-clause)
* ``rpz``
  - implementes a subset of the RPZ_ format. Currently it can be used with a zonefile, a binary database support is on the way. Binary database can be updated by an external process on the fly.
* custom filter function

There are several defined actions:

* ``PASS`` - let the query pass through
* ``DENY`` - return NXDOMAIN answer
* ``DROP`` - terminate query resolution, returns SERVFAIL to requestor
* ``TC`` - set TC=1 if the request came through UDP, forcing client to retry with TCP
* ``FORWARD(ip)`` - solve a query via forwarding to an IP while validating and caching locally;
  the parameter can be a single IP (string) or a lua list of up to four IPs.
* ``STUB(ip)`` - similar to ``FORWARD(ip)`` but *without* attempting DNSSEC validation.
  Each request may be either answered from cache or simply sent to one of the IPs with proxying back the answer.
* ``MIRROR(ip)`` - mirror query to given IP and continue solving it (useful for partial snooping)
* ``REROUTE({{subnet,target}, ...})`` - reroute addresses in response matching given subnet to given target, e.g. ``{'192.0.2.0/24', '127.0.0.0'}`` will rewrite '192.0.2.55' to '127.0.0.55', see :ref:`renumber module <mod-renumber>` for more information.
* ``QTRACE`` - pretty-print DNS response packets into the log (useful for debugging weird DNS servers).
* ``FLAGS(set, clear)`` - set and/or clear some flags for the query.  There can be multiple flags to set/clear.  You can just pass a single flag name (string) or a set of names.

.. warning:: The policy module currently only looks at whole DNS requests.  The rules won't be re-applied e.g. when following CNAMEs.

.. note:: The module (and ``kres``) expects domain names in wire format, not textual representation. So each label in name is prefixed with its length, e.g. "example.com" equals to ``"\7example\3com"``. You can use convenience function ``todname('example.com')`` for automatic conversion.

Example configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: lua

	-- Load default policies
	modules = { 'policy' }
	-- Whitelist 'www[0-9].badboy.cz'
	policy.add(policy.pattern(policy.PASS, '\4www[0-9]\6badboy\2cz'))
	-- Block all names below badboy.cz
	policy.add(policy.suffix(policy.DENY, {todname('badboy.cz.')}))
	-- Custom rule
	policy.add(function (req, query)
		if query:qname():find('%d.%d.%d.224\7in-addr\4arpa') then
			return policy.DENY
		end
	end)
	-- Disallow ANY queries
	policy.add(function (req, query)
		if query.stype == kres.type.ANY then
			return policy.DROP
		end
	end)
	-- Enforce local RPZ
	policy.add(policy.rpz(policy.DENY, 'blacklist.rpz'))
	-- Forward all queries below 'company.se' to given resolver
	policy.add(policy.suffix(policy.FORWARD('192.168.1.1'), {todname('company.se')}))
	-- Forward all queries matching pattern
	policy.add(policy.pattern(policy.FORWARD('2001:DB8::1'), '\4bad[0-9]\2cz'))
	-- Forward all queries (complete stub mode)
	policy.add(policy.all(policy.FORWARD('2001:DB8::1')))
	-- Print all responses with matching suffix
	policy.add(policy.suffix(policy.QTRACE, {todname('rhybar.cz.')}))
	-- Print all responses
	policy.add(policy.all(policy.QTRACE))
  -- Mirror all queries and retrieve information
  local rule = policy.add(policy.all(policy.MIRROR('127.0.0.2')))
  -- Print information about the rule
  print(string.format('id: %d, matched queries: %d', rule.id, rule.count)
  -- Reroute all addresses found in answer from 192.0.2.0/24 to 127.0.0.x
  -- this policy is enforced on answers, therefore 'postrule'
  local rule = policy.add(policy.REROUTE({'192.0.2.0/24', '127.0.0.0'}), true)
  -- Delete rule that we just created
  policy.del(rule.id)

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

.. envvar:: policy.PASS

   Pass-through all queries matching the rule.

.. envvar:: policy.DENY

   Respond with NXDOMAIN to all queries matching the rule.

.. envvar:: policy.DROP

   Drop all queries matching the rule.

.. envvar:: policy.TC

   Respond with empty answer with TC bit set (if the query came through UDP).

.. envvar:: policy.FORWARD (address)

   Forward query to given IP address.

.. envvar:: policy.MIRROR (address)

   Forward query to given IP address.

.. envvar:: policy.REROUTE({{subnet,target}, ...})

   Reroute addresses in response matching given subnet to given target, e.g. ``{'192.0.2.0/24', '127.0.0.0'}`` will rewrite '192.0.2.55' to '127.0.0.55'.

.. envvar:: policy.QTRACE

   Print pretty-formate (dig-like) DNS answers for current query and
   all its subqueries that Knot Resolver receive from upstream
   (authoritative) DNS servers.  Very useful when dealing with
   non-compliant DNS servers that violate DNS protocol.

.. function:: policy.add(rule, postrule)

  :param rule: added rule, i.e. ``policy.pattern(policy.DENY, '[0-9]+\2cz')``
  :param postrule: boolean, if true the rule will be evaluated on answer instead of query
  :return: rule description
  
  Add a new policy rule that is executed either or queries or answers, depending on the ``postrule`` parameter. You can then use the returned rule description to get information and unique identifier for the rule, as well as match count.

.. function:: policy.del(id)

  :param id: identifier of a given rule
  :return: boolean
  
  Remove a rule from policy list.

.. function:: policy.all(action)

  :param action: executed action for all queries
  
  Perform action for all queries (no filtering).

.. function:: policy.pattern(action, pattern)

  :param action: action if the pattern matches QNAME
  :param pattern: regular expression
  
  Policy to block queries based on the QNAME regex matching.

.. function:: policy.suffix(action, suffix_table)

  :param action: action if the pattern matches QNAME
  :param suffix_table: table of valid suffixes
  
  Policy to block queries based on the QNAME suffix match.

.. function:: policy.suffix_common(action, suffix_table[, common_suffix])

  :param action: action if the pattern matches QNAME
  :param suffix_table: table of valid suffixes
  :param common_suffix: common suffix of entries in suffix_table
  
  Like suffix match, but you can also provide a common suffix of all matches for faster processing (nil otherwise).
  This function is faster for small suffix tables (in the order of "hundreds").

.. function:: policy.rpz(action, path[, format])

  :param action: the default action for match in the zone (e.g. RH-value `.`)
  :param path: path to zone file | database
  
  Enforce RPZ_ rules. This can be used in conjunction with published blocklist feeds.
  The RPZ_ operation is well described in this `Jan-Piet Mens's post`_,
  or the `Pro DNS and BIND`_ book. Here's compatibility table:

  .. csv-table::
   :header: "Policy Action", "RH Value", "Support"

   "NXDOMAIN", "``.``", "**yes**"
   "NODATA", "``*.``", "*partial*, implemented as NXDOMAIN"
   "Unchanged", "``rpz-passthru.``", "**yes**"
   "Nothing", "``rpz-drop.``", "**yes**"
   "Truncated", "``rpz-tcp-only.``", "**yes**"
   "Modified", "anything", "no"

  .. csv-table::
   :header: "Policy Trigger", "Support"

   "QNAME", "**yes**"
   "CLIENT-IP", "*partial*, may be done with :ref:`views <mod-view>`"
   "IP", "no"
   "NSDNAME", "no"
   "NS-IP", "no"

.. function:: policy.todnames({name, ...})

   :param: names table of domain names in textual format
   
   Returns table of domain names in wire format converted from strings.

   .. code-block:: lua

      -- Convert single name
      assert(todname('example.com') == '\7example\3com\0')
      -- Convert table of names
      policy.todnames({'example.com', 'me.cz'})
      { '\7example\3com\0', '\2me\2cz\0' }
