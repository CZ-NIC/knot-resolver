.. _mod-nsid:

Name Server Identifier (NSID)
-----------------------------

This module provides server-side support for :rfc:`5001`
and is not enabled by default.

DNS clients can request resolver to send back its NSID along with the reply
to a DNS request.  This is useful for identification of resolver instances
in larger services (using anycast or load balancers).


This is useful tool for debugging larger services,
as it reveals which particular resolver instance sent the reply.

NSID value can be configured in the resolver's configuration file:

.. code-block:: lua

   modules.load('nsid')
   nsid.name('instance 1')

.. tip:: When dealing with multiple kresd instances managed with
   systemd, see :ref:`instance-specific-configuration`.

You can also obtain configured NSID value:

.. code-block:: lua

   nsid.name()
   instance 1

The module can be disabled at run-time:

.. code-block:: lua

   modules.unload('nsid')
