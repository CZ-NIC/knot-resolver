.. _mod-serve_stale:

Serve stale
===========

Demo module that allows using timed-out records in case kresd is
unable to contact upstream servers.

By default it allows stale-ness by up to one day,
after roughly four seconds trying to contact the servers.
It's quite configurable/flexible; see the beginning of the module source for details.
See also the RFC draft_ (not fully followed) and :any:`cache.ns_tout`.
