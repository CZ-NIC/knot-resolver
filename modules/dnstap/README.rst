Dnstap (traffic collection)
===========================

in `dnstap format <https://dnstap.info>`_ using fstrm framing library.
This logging is useful if you need effectivelly log all DNS traffic.

The unix socket and the socket reader must be present before starting resolver instances.

Tunables:

* ``socket_path``: the the unix socket file where dnstap messages will be sent
* ``log_responses``: if ``true`` responses in wire format will be logged
