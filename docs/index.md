# The Knot Resolver documentation has been moved!

Due to ongoing issues with ReadTheDocs, we have decided to move the
documentation to our own infrastructure, built using our own CI/CD pipeline.

Please follow one of the links below to see the documentation:

* [Knot Resolver 5 (stable)](https://www.knot-resolver.cz/documentation/stable/)

* [Knot Resolver 6 (early-access)](https://www.knot-resolver.cz/documentation/latest/)

We apologize for the inconvenience!
